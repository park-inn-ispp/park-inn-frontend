| Day           |   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Day 1         |    :smiley: (Meaning that I am learning, I like the work and I think I can do it without problems, but with some effort) |
| Day 2         |    - (Meaning that I did no work regarding the ISPP project)           |
| Day 3         |    :neutral_face:  (Meaning that I feel I had to struggle, but the assigned work was fair and the day productive)          |:fearful:
| Day 4         |    :worried: (Meaning that I feel I have serious difficulties to accomplish the task, or the productivity of my day was awful)           |
| Day 5         |    :fearful:   (IÂ´m desperate, I need help)        |
